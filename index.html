<h1> About Me </h1>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p> My name is Kinza Haque and I am currently a first-year ITM student. I was born in Chicago, but my parents are from Pakistan. I am interested in learning about websites because I want to create one for my own Instagram-based business, "@MantledInModesty".</p>
  <p> Currently, I am still new to learning coding but I want to gain more knowledge. </p>
